## Overview

<a href="#">HoudahGeo for macOS</a> is crafted for photographers and researchers who rely on accurate geographic metadata to organize, archive and analyze their image collections. Instead of manually tagging photos or relying on inconsistent camera GPS data, HoudahGeo provides a structured workflow for assigning precise coordinates, locations and altitude information to images. It supports GPS track logs, location lookup, map-based navigation and direct integration with mapping services to ensure that metadata is both accurate and consistent.

The application excels at handling large photo libraries. Users can load entire sessions, match timestamped images to GPS tracks, correct time drift, refine positions manually and annotate additional context for future reference. This workflow is crucial for professionals who depend on reliable geodata—environmental researchers, travel photographers, field surveyors and archivists who require clean metadata for sorting, cataloguing or client delivery. HoudahGeo’s validation tools help identify gaps, mismatches or missing coordinates before the images are exported.

On macOS, HoudahGeo integrates seamlessly with Photos, Lightroom, Finder and system mapping APIs. Export workflows maintain EXIF integrity while enabling users to publish georeferenced images, KML files, GPX tracks and location datasets. Over time, HoudahGeo becomes a cornerstone in photo-organization pipelines, ensuring that location data stays correct across formats, edits and migrations—something that automated tools often fail to guarantee.
